# Associations among elements in freshwater mussel shells (Unionidae) and their relation to morphology and life history 
Data, isometric log ration calculations, and code for analysis of shell ionomics data set. Import data set and run principle components analysis (PCA) to identify linearly independent ratios among nutrients called sequential binary partition.
Excel spread sheet for calculations of ILRs. 

From Parent et al. 2008. The plant ionome revisited by the nutrient balance concept in Fronteirs. 
Dtermine the number of ilrs to construct by determine how many axes have eigenvalues > 1.
