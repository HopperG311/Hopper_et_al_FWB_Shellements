# Shell_ionomics
Code for analysis of shell ionomics data set. Import data set and run principle components analysis (PCA) to identify linearly independent ratios among nutrients called sequential binary partition
From Parent et al. 2008. The plant ionome revisited by the nutrient balance concept in Fronteirs. 
Dtermine the number of ilrs to construct by determine how many axes have eigenvalues > 1. 

Follow up with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) testing for interspecific difference in elemental compostion using log transformated element data. 
When null hypothesis is rejected, use analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each element. 
Plot element compostion as boxplot for each species for supplement.
